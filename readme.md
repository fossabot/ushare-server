# The server of uShare 

Welcome to the private repository of the server of uShare.
Run `npm install` inside the *server* folder then run `iojs main.js`.
**io.js is needed** else you need to enable ES6 in node.js because we use ES6.

See files inside the *docs* folder to understand the architecture of this app and write the better code of the entire world.

**Welcome in the paradise !**
